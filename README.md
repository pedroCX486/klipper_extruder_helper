# KlipperExtruderHelper

This thing was made with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. It'll automatically open a page on `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. If running from a subfolder, run `npm run build:subfolder`. Remember to edit on package.json what subfolder you'll want it to run from.
